# Sign-up_Form
This sign-up page was created as a learning exercise for HTML forms, CSS framework Bootstrap, and CSS preprocessor SASS.

After completing the project, I have learned that Bootstrap can quickly create web pages, but it meets limitations and frustrations when trying to implement specific details or positioning to the layout. A similar and more customized layout can be achieved by writing up one's own HTML and CSS instead. Bootstrap remains a useful tool in web development for its easy to implement components.
